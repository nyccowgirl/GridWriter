1. polymorphism examples:
    private GridItem items[];
    items = new GridItem[INITIAL_CAPACITY];
    public void add(GridItem item) {
    GridItem temp[] = new GridItem[items.length * 2];
    public class MyCircle extends GridItem {
    public class MyRectangle extends GridItem {

2. x and y are inherited from GridItem class as protected instance variables.

3. The respective containsPoint methods of MyCircle and MyRectangle overrode the containsPoint method of GridItem.

4. Since GridItem's containsPoint is never instantiated separately and is overridden from the inherited classes, it
could have been an abstract method to make the code cleaner. The constructor for MySquare could have inherited from
MyRectangle.

5. Since getArea and containsPoint are methods required for each type of shape, they could have been included in an
Interface to force methods to be written to ensure that each inherited class would incorporate them.
